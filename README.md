# YES_teknicSys CU-Brick CDPR Control Program

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive robot control system for cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) with integrated gripper and rail control. It supports calibration, manual operation, automated brick placement, trajectory execution, and demo modes. The system is designed for use with a Windows environment and leverages Visual Studio Code for development.

> **Note:** The `ver_2` folder contains the main source code and resources for the CDPR (Cable-Driven Parallel Robot) control program.  
> **Note:** In addition, `ver_2` includes Python programs for calibration, such as `dxfextract.py`, which is used with a Leica laser measurement device to acquire the relative location of attachment points at the poles and the end effector. This tool extracts the end effector location relative to the pole attachment points using inverse kinematics (IK).  

## Features

- **Calibration Mode:** Set cable torques, update robot position/configuration, control individual motors, and clear alerts.
- **Operation Mode:** Control robot position, run brick placement routines, execute point-to-point and trajectory files, save/load positions, and run demo sequences.
- **Gripper & Rail Control:** Full menu-driven control for gripper and rail motors.
- **Logging:** All operations are logged for traceability.
- **File-based Configuration:** Robot configuration and last position are loaded from JSON and TXT files.
- **Network Integration:** Can request position data from a Raspberry Pi via UDP.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Visual Studio 20xx Developer Command Prompt
- Visual Studio Code
- Required hardware connected and powered

### Build

1. Open the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.
2. Change directory to the `ver_2` folder:
   ```sh
   code ./ver_2
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   Terminal -> Run Build Task C/C++: cl.exe build active files.
   ```

### Run

1. Execute the program:
   ```sh
   ./bin/Main.exe
   ```

## Usage

On startup, the program loads configuration from `RobotConfig.json` and attempts to recover the last position from `lastPos.txt`. You will be presented with a menu to select Calibration or Operation mode.

### Calibration Mode

For setup, diagnostics, and maintenance. Menu options:

1. **Set Cables Torque**  
   Adjust the tension of all cables for safe operation.
2. **Request current cable motor torque readings**  
   Display the measured torque for each cable motor.
3. **Control Cable Motor**  
   Manually operate individual cable motors for diagnostics or setup.
4. **Update Robot Pos**  
   Load robot position from a file and update the system state.
5. **Reset EE Rotation to Zero**  
   Set the end effector’s rotation angles to zero.
6. **Control Linear Rail Motor**  
   Manually operate rail motors for calibration or troubleshooting.
7. **Control Gripper**  
   Open, close, rotate, release, or calibrate the gripper.
8. **Update Robot Config**  
   Load a new robot configuration from a JSON file.
9. **Print Robot Status**  
   Show current end effector position, rail offsets, and cable lengths.
10. **Clear Exception**  
    Reset any error or alert states in the cable motors.
11. **Robot Control Mode**  
    Enter the main robot control menu for position and gripper operations.
12. **Request Current Position from RPi**  
    Query the robot’s position from a Raspberry Pi over UDP.
q. **Finish Calibration**  
   Exit calibration mode and return to the main menu.

### Operation Mode

For running robot tasks, brick placement, and demos. Menu options:

1. **Robot Control**  
   Access robot position control, move to home/pre-pickup, gripper and rail control.
2. **Read Brick Positions File**  
   Load a CSV file with brick positions and run automated pick-and-place routines.
3. **Read Point-to-Point Path File**  
   Execute a sequence of robot movements from a CSV file of points.
4. **Read Trajectory File**  
   Run a pre-defined trajectory from a CSV file.
5. **Request current cable motor torque readings**  
   Display the measured torque for each cable motor.
6. **Save Current EE Pos to File**  
   Save the current end effector position to a file for later recall.
7. **Print Robot Status**  
   Show current end effector position, rail offsets, and cable lengths.
8. **Demo Mode**  
   Run a demonstration sequence using a sample brick position file.
q. **Exit**  
   Exit operation mode and return to the main menu.
